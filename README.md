# Battery discharger for linux
--- 
"acpi" required 

This is a fairly simple but very useful script for saving the state of a laptop battery during long-term storage. It runs on Linux.
Just run this script after charging the laptop and it will turn it off by itself when the battery is between 60 and 70% charged.
